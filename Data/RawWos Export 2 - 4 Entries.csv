The model is trained on existing levels, represented as a categorical distribution, to accurately capture the game's fundamental mechanics and design principles. The proposed approach demonstrates notable success in producing high-quality and diverse levels, with a significant proportion being playable by an artificial agent. This research emphasizes the potential of diffusion models as an efficient tool for procedural content generation and highlights their potential impact on the development of new video games and the enhancement of existing games through generated content.","[Lee, Hyeon Joon; Simo-Serra, Edgar] Waseda Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Lee, HJ (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",hyeonjoon.lee@toki.waseda.jp; ess@waseda.jp,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-4-88552-343-4,,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV6IL,,,,,30/10/2023,WOS:001057888900034,0

A special class of these methods, which is commonly known as search-based PCG, treats the given task as an optimisation problem. Such problems are predominantly tackled by evolutionary algorithms.We will demonstrate in this paper that obtaining more information about the defined optimisation problem can substantially improve our understanding of how to approach the generation of content. To do so, we present and discuss three efficient analysis tools, namely diagonal walks, the estimation of high-level properties, as well as problem similarity measures. We discuss the purpose of each of the considered methods in the context of PCG and provide guidelines for the interpretation of the results received. This way we aim to provide methods for the comparison of PCG approaches and eventually, increase the quality and practicality of generated content in industry.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a 3-D generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, we are able to create arbitrarily sized world snippets from a given sample. Our method applies dense representations used in natural language processing in two ways. First, we propose block2vec representations based on word2vec. Second, we use the pretrained large language model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to generate representations directly from the token names. These representations make Wor(l)d-GAN independent of the number of different blocks, which can vary a lot in Minecraft, and enable the generation of larger levels. We evaluate our approach on creations from the community as well as structures generated with the Minecraft World Generator under several metrics. Wor(l)d-GAN enables its users to generate Minecraft worlds based on parts of their creations.","[Awiszus, Maren; Schubert, Frederik; Rosenhahn, Bodo] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Informat Verarbeitung, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Schubert, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Informat Verarbeitung, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",awiszus@tnt.uni-hannover.de; schubert@tnt.uni-hannover.de; rosenhahn@tnt.uni-hannover.de,,,"Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany [01DD20003]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [EXC 2122]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was supported in part by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, through the project LeibnizKILabor under Grant 01DD20003 and in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany's Excellence Strategy within the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixDunder Grant EXC 2122.",,43,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2475-1502,2475-1510,,IEEE T GAMES,IEEE Trans.

There is growing interest in PCG for its potential to enable creativity support tools (CST): software that can assist and proactively collaborate with human practitioners to iterate on generative algorithms towards a creative design goal. While declarative programming tools, especially logic programming and solvers, offer many appealing benefits for PCG, there remain barriers to their adoption. In this paper, we focus on the specific challenge of inspecting execution: the important role in PCG of being able to visualize a generative algorithm's intermediate states and see them as meaningful.","[Martens, Chris] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Martens, C (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",c.martens@northeastern.edu,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-24840-5; 978-3-031-24841-2,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,13880,,,,,,XIII,XV,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV0CH,,,,,30/10/2023,WOS:000968090200001,0
