This repository contains both the data and the siple visualisation code for a survey of the evaluation methods used in research papers that introduced a novel PCG system for generating game levels.

This survey formed the basis of paper titled 'On the Evaluation of Procedural Level Generation Systems' by Withington, Tokarchuk and Cook. Preprint available here: [arxiv link]. Paper has been accepted for publication at the 2024 Foundations of Digital Games conference in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA (http://fdg2024.org/).
